#### Streamer

Will monitor recent tweets and identify the top N most recent tuples. This is useful for identifying trending topics.

#### Purestream

A very simple filter implementation to to monitor the twitter stream at-large for an arbitrary number of targets. This is particularly useful for monitoring rapidly fluid situations, i.e. mass casualties, sports events, award shows, etc. . .


#### TODO:
- The list of stop-words is decent but should be adapted to the Twitterspace

- I would prefer a moving window, which would be much more representative of current events without giving too much due to historical events

- It would be easy to have a keypress to refresh the history

- Make it prettier!
