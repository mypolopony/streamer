#### Streamer

This Streamer is unfortunately named because it refers to several very different functions interacting with the Twitter API.

# 1) Monitor recent tweets and identify the top N most recent tuples. This is useful for identifying trending topics.


# 2) A very simple filter implementation to to monitor the twitter stream at-large for an arbitrary number of targets. This is useful for monitoring rapidly fluid situations, i.e. mass casualties, sports events, award shows, by keyword(s)


# 3) A personal Twitter account manager which sanitizes previosu posts, queues future posts and maintains a local database of tweets

But not *that* much.

Who knew endless texts and phone calls, somewhere between awkard and threatening, could be yours for just a small payment of $7.

Actually, there may be many missing: I thought that I had gone through screenshots to find the rare captures of the text file, an off-hand glimpse of the brilliant ideas previously noted, but either that was a dream or I've entirely forgotten where it is. . .
