#### Streamer is. . .

A simple example of how to monitor a twitter stream and pick out progressively important trends.

It's not hard at all, and it can be interesting with the filter.  
  

#### TODO:
The list of stop-words is decent but should be adapted to the Twitterspace. 

I would prefer a moving window, which would be much more representative of current events without giving too much due to historical events.

Make it prettier!
